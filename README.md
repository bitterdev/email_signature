Would you like to append a signature to all outgoing emails on your site, for example, to fulfill the legal conditions of your country? Or would you like to add other information to your emails? Then this add-on is the right choice for you.

The add-on is multilingual and allows you to define separate signatures for each available locale. Furthermore, the WYSIWYG editor provides powerful formatting options. After you have defined your signatures, the add-on hooks into the mail system of concrete5 and appends the signature to all outgoing emails. The HTML version of the email and also the text version of the email will be manipulated.

Examples are e.g. welcome mails, contact request confirmations, order confirmations (e.g. generated by the Bitter Shop System or by Community Store) and all other emails that are sent by your site. No matter if the email were sent by the core system or by a third-party add-on.

**Instructions**

- Go to the settings page (Dashboard > Email Signature)
- Write your signature(s) (one per locale; fallback signature is the default locale)
- Save, you're done.
